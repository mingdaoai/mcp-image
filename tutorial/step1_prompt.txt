Create a function genImage to generate image using flux model on replicate

It takes the image prompt and output_full_path as arguments.

Example code:

import replicate
output = replicate.run(
    "black-forest-labs/flux-schnell",
    input={
        "prompt": "black forest gateau cake spelling out the words \"FLUX SCHNELL\", tasty, food photography, dynamic shot",
        "go_fast": True,
        "megapixels": "1",
        "num_outputs": 1,
        "aspect_ratio": "1:1",
        "output_format": "webp",
        "output_quality": 80,
        "num_inference_steps": 4
    }
)
API key for replicate is at ~/.mingdaoai/replicate.key

Add a __main__ block to test the function, and write the output to output.png in dir of __file__
